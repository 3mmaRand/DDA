## Reproducibility is key!

One definition
*"... obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis."*. `r Cite(myBib, "National_Academies_of_Sciences_Engineering2019-sb")`

## Rationale for scripting analysis

Science is the generation of ideas, designing work to test them and reporting the results.

```

---

## Rationale for scripting analysis

We ensure **replicability** of laboratory and field work by planning and recording in lab books and using standard protocols. 


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rationale2.png")
```

Even so replicating results can be hard.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rationale3.png")
```


Workflows for data analysis and reporting can, and should, be 100% **reproducible**! Scripting is a way to achieve this.

## Rationale for scripting analysis

That reproducibility applies to all aspects of the data workflow.

From importing or collecting the data, processing it for analysis, building statistical models and communicating the methods and results.

# Why R?


---

## Why R?

Open source and free

--

-  leverages all willing expertise

-  problems are solved quickly

-  innovations appear often and quickly

-  fosters collaboration and community

-  abundant support

---

## Why R?

Open source and free

--
 .......But so is Python
  
--

R has reputation for catering to users who do not see themselves as programmers, and allowing them to slide gradually into programming.


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/biologist1.png")
```


---

## Why R?

Domain specific

--

Designed for data analysis and graphics - which means it is often easier to achieve those tasks in R than a general purpose programming language.

---

## Why R?

The R community is one of R's greatest assets. Vibrant, supportive, inclusive.

# Why make a package?

---

## Why make a package?

Conventionally:

-  Package developers  

-  Generalisable analytical methods  

-  For use on other data  

-  Public release


---

## Why make a package?

Package up your data analysis project!

-  You don't need to have a collection of highly generalisation functions

-  You don't need to share it with anyone else

-  If you are already trying to work reproducibly you are almost doing it anyway!

-  But it will help you do it better


---

## Why make a package?

If you are already trying to work reproducibly you are almost doing it anyway!

```
/stem-cell-proteomic
   /data-raw
   /date-processed
   /figures
   /R
   README.md
   report.Rmd
   stem-cell-proteomic.RProj

```
â€¦ making a package is just a short step beyond that


---

## I don't do *any* coding...


..and I'm not about to start!

You can still make steps towards reproducibility

-  organise your data `r Cite(myBib, c("JSSv059i10", "Broman2018-vt"))`
-  describe your data with metadata
-  have a data management plan e.g. [UK Data Service Checklist](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/plan-to-share/checklist/)
-  have a consistent directory structure
-  have a consistent naming system e.g see Jenny Bryan's [Naming things](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf)
-  Have a look at [Reproducible Research in R](https://r-cubed.rostools.org/index.html)

## How to make a package?

Easier than you think!

-  Use RStudio
-  Use **`devtools`** - many helper functions


---

## How to make a package?

Create a package!

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_package("myanalysis")
```

-  It is a package and an RStudio project.
-  DESCRIPTION provides metadata about your package.
-  R/ directory for code

## How to make a package?

Metadata in DESCRIPTION

-  Title  
-  Version  
-  Authors  
-  Description  
-  License  


---

## How to make a package?

Document your package!

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::document()
```


---

## How to make a package?

Check your package!

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::check()

## Summary

-  Few biologists want to learn to code  
-  We do want our work to reproduce  
-  We can take steps towards reproducibility  
-  R is cool!
-  If you are an R user, you can make a package  
-  Encourages and supports reproducibility  
-  Helps you document your analysis  
-  Helps you test and check your analysis  
-  Is made easy with devtools and friends
