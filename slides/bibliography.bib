  abstract = "Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most
              researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills
              for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses
              can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited
              in how effectively they can work with software and data.
              Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab
              projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps,
              and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers
              new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper
              presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher
              can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational
              skill. These practices, which encompass data management,
              programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects,
              tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide
              variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our

               promise to let us personalize therapy. Data processing, however,
               is often not described well enough to allow for exact
               reproduction of the results, leading to exercises in ``forensic
               bioinformatics'' where aspects of raw data and reported results
               are used to infer what methods must have been employed.
               Unfortunately, poor documentation can shift from an
               inconvenience to an active danger when it obscures not just
               methods but errors. In this report we examine several related
               papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug
               sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response.
               Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to
               treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show
               in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple
               errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that
               emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or
               column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most
               simple errors are common. We then discuss steps we are taking to
               avoid such errors in our own investigations.]",
